        <h1>How to reheat Lasagna</h1>
        <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly. </p>

        <h1>How to Freeze Lasagna</h1>
        <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months. </p>
        
        <h3>How to reheat Frozen Lasagna</h3>
        <p>Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through. </p>
